            <p id="prevedu">I was previously in Salpaus studying carpentry around 10 years ago, <br>
            specializing in CNC machines and their programming.<br>
            Most work experience i have is from working in construction sites <br>
            throughout the years. <br>
            I was in the military 7 years ago in the Missile Air Defence Battery.<br>
            (a loose translation.) <br>
            In my spare time i have been studying programming,<br>
            so from that i just have some random certifications to show for, for now.</p>
