            <!--Biography-->
            <h3 id="biography1">A short biography</h3>
            <p id="biography"> I was born 1999 in Lahti, Finland. Ever since I was a kid<br>
            I have been interested in technology, software and especially games.<br>
            My older brother introduced me to video games <br> when I was around 2 years old<br>
            and almost immediately i started being interested in how the games work<br>
            and what is possible to do inside it. When i was around 10 years old<br>
            I did not like the music in this one older game so i somehow <br>
            figured out how to change the music in the gamefiles.<br>
            When i was around 13 i was changing the config files and messing with code<br>
            to make games look and behave differently.<br>
            From that my interest and curiosity in this stuff has been growing.</p>
<!--Interests and passions-->
<h3 id="interests1">Interests and Passions</h3>
            <p id="interests">I have many interests some of which i have listed<br>
            in the Hobbies page. But in short i enjoy spending time with <br> family and friends <br>
            and i am interested in pretty much everything to do with <br> computers, software and games.</p>

        <!--Goals and motivations-->
        <h3 id="goals1">Goals and Motivations</h3>
            <p id="goals">As I have said earlier, i have always been interested in software and games.<br>
            My goal is to improve at programming/coding and everything to do with it.<br>
            Becoming a game developer is something i will work towards, <br> even though it might be<br>
            a bit unrealistic especially at beginner level. Starting my own company<br>
            is also one of my goals which i'm starting to work towards as is improve.<br>
            Becoming a good programmer will help me bring these ideas i have to light.
